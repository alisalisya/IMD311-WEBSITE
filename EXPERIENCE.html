<p style="color:brown;"><b>As an ordinary young girl, of course I do have few experiences in my life that actually give value to me.</b></p>
<p style="color:brown;"><b>I have some memories of experience that I could never forget throughout my life.</b></p>
<p><b>life must be sad sometimes..</b></p>

<p style="color:cadetblue;"><b>2018 ; My senior year, I still remembered the day my friends and I received a bad news regarding to our beloved warden at hostel that needed to be transferred to other school. So, we decided to make last surprise party for him at hostel and gave him our handmade gifts made by students at our school. The memory of us not getting sleep for few days for the party preparation were still remained fresh in my mind. The experience of working together with friends and junior really makes me wanna smile until today. Sad but great! </b></p>

<p style="color:cadetblue;"><b>I believe those words saying we live only once in this life so enjoy your everyday like there's no tommorow. Before pandemic hitting our life, I was such an active person. I love active activities such as camping, running event and so on. I did participated in few event such as camping and 'Pink Walk' together with my friends. Instead of only sleeping and doing nothing, the least I can do is enjoy my time with friends and move to make my body become healthier. As my people always said, do it while you still can!</b></p>
